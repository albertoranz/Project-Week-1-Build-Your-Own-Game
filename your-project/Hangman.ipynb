    "The goal is to guess the word to save the hangman from death. Enter one letter at a time to see if it’s in the word. If you have guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the blank spaces. If the letter is not in the word, you loose a life. The initial number of lifes is 7. If the word is not guessed before spending all 7 lifes, the game ends and you loose. If you guess the whole word, you win!!"
